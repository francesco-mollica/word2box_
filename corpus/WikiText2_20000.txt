unk advantages
rowson argues white black certain advantages
white advantages
according rowson white first advantage advantage first move similarities serve tennis white score ace instance powerful opening novelty control pace direction game second serve things go wrong position usually losing second white begins game initiative although rowson regards psychological rather positional advantage whether leads positional advantage depends relative skill players third players able use initiative play kind powerful serve volley chess black flattened mixture deep preparation attacking prowess fourth white wants draw often easy black prevent advantage particularly acute cases possible threefold repetition white begin repetition without committing draw black decide whether deviate knows whether white unk
rowson cites example last phenomenon well regarded zaitsev variation ruy lopez 1e4 e5 2nf3 nc6 unk a6 unk nf6 5 0 0 be7 unk b5 unk 0 0 unk d6 unk bb7 unk re8 initiating zaitsev variation white repeat moves unk rf8 unk puts black awkward situation since must either insist zaitsev 12 re8 allows white choose whether draw threefold repetition unk rf8 unk play different move b play different possibly inferior variation playing something 12 re8
black advantages
rowson argues black also several advantages first white alleged advantage also kind obligation play win black often use advantage second white extra move burden sometimes white finds mild form unk unk lite third although white begins game initiative black retains flexible position good reactive possibilities initiative absorbed often passes black fourth fact white moves black often gives black useful information suba likewise argues white advantage actually less move since white must tip hand first allowing black react white plans suba writes terms mathematical games theory chess game complete information black information always greater one move
rowson also notes black chances increase markedly playing good openings tend flexibility latent potential rather give white fixed targets try take initiative prematurely also emphasizes white initiative advantage success black depends seeing beyond initiative thinking positions terms potential ideas exemplified hedgehog dynamic modern system english opening arise various move orders typical position arises 1c4 c5 2nf3 nf6 unk b6 unk bb7 5 0 0 e6 unk be7 unk cxd4 unk d6 unk a6 white spatial advantage black often maneuvers pieces last two ranks board white keep constant eye possible liberating pawn unk b5 d5 watson remarks black goal remain elastic flexible many options pieces whereas white become unk point need protect various dynamic pawn breaks also observes white tends much tied black latent activity black tied white space advantage moreover attempts white overrun black position often rebound unk example following unk game

examination reversed symmetrical openings illustrates white black respective advantages
unk openings
reversed opening white plays opening typically played black colors reversed thus extra tempo evans writes openings defense considered good black must even better white move hand former world champion mikhail unk reportedly expressed view watson questions idea citing suba thesis black moving second complete information white writes everyone difficulties playing white sicilian defence 1e4 c5 leading masters qualms answering 1c4 1 e5 explain paradox watson discusses several different reversed sicilian lines showing black exploit disadvantages various extra moves white concludes point black set sicilian fine reactive system worth much trying claim initiative white true black able react specific plan white chooses suba terms information indeed move greater furthermore able take advantage dead equal positions white hoping retain advantage first move would normally avoid
watson also observes similarly dutch defence looks particularly sterile white achieves reversed positions tempo turns nothing useful indeed many standard black openings inspiring one gets white tempo hand gm alex unk likewise notes gm vladimir unk successful exponent leningrad dutch 1d4 unk unk g6 highest levels made deep impression unk unk someone suggestion try unk white unk said extra move gonna hurt
unk also agrees alekhine criticism unk e5 2nf3 reversed alekhine defense unk alekhine baden baden 1925 writing alekhine understood difference opening philosophies white black realized white supposed try obtaining comfortable game reversed colour opening set ups statistics show surprisingly lot people white even score well black positions extra tempo howard unk generally considered strongest player world 1843 1851 made similar point 160 years ago writing owen defense 1e4 b6 playable black unk inferior customary first moves essentially defensive current view owen defense slightly better white unk playable less likely yield opening advantage 1e4 unk
watson concludes moves disadvantages well advantages extra move always unk blessing b extra information white black better react new situation c draw likely acceptable black white white unk avoid lines allow unk unk black may object lines
symmetrical openings
rowson writes general one would assume whatever advantage white would revealed clearly symmetrical positions accordingly watson suba evans eminent player theorist unk unk 1886 1935 argued black interest avoid symmetry nonetheless even symmetrical opening lines sometimes illustrate tenuous nature white advantage several respects
often difficult white prove advantage symmetrical opening lines gm bent larsen wrote unk game began 1c4 c5 unk b6 symmetrical openings white theoretical advantage many theoretical gm andrew soltis wrote 2008 hates playing symmetrical unk defense 1e4 e5 2nf3 nf6 accordingly varies unk vienna game however unable find way advantage symmetrical 2 nc6 unk g6 unk bg7 unk nf6 unk four knights game unk unk 5 0 0 0 0 unk d6 unk unk unk nd4 unk unk unk unk unk unk unk unk unk unk unk d5 unk e4 may even favor black
moreover symmetrical positions may unk white commit first watson notes even difficult white play unk symmetrical position since almost every move certain drawbacks fischer went far claim unk nf6 unk g6 unk bg7 4 0 0 0 0 unk d6 reinhard fischer western open 1963 believe black stands better whatever white black vary get asymmetrical position superior position due better pawn structure however gm paul unk responded unk magazine believe symmetrical positions hodgson unk portisch tal games discussed illustrate black continue imitate white long finds feasible desirable deviate ceases case
particular extra move sometimes liability asset example soltis notes exchange french position arising 1e4 e6 unk d5 unk unk unk nf6 pretty equal position black knight moved e4 arises unk defense 1e4 e5 2nf3 nf6 unk d6 unk unk unk d5 position offers white better chances precisely black extra move ne4 allows advanced knight become target attack
finally symmetrical positions may difficult white player psychological reasons watson writes anyone tries exchange french even thinks playing win assume psychological burden white already ceded advantage first move knows whereas black challenged find ways seize initiative two famous examples white losses exchange french gurevich short unk korchnoi gurevich short game two world leading players white needed draw qualify candidates unk black needed win gurevich played passively unk short achieved necessary win qualified candidates ultimately went challenge kasparov world championship unk korchnoi italian im fell victim korchnoi unk mating attack losing 14 moves

jonathan rowson speculated principle possible machine develop 32 piece tablebases may take decades even centuries unless runaway global warming nuclear war gets way think eventually happen however information theorist claude shannon argued feasible computer actually 1950 paper programming computer playing chess writes
chess possible principle play perfect game construct machine follows one considers given position possible moves moves opponent etc end game variation end must occur rules games finite number moves remembering 50 move drawing rule variations ends win loss draw working backward end one determine whether forced win position draw lost easy show however even high computing speed available electronic calculators computation impractical typical chess positions order 30 legal moves number holds fairly constant game nearly finished shown de unk averaged number legal moves large number master games thus move white one black gives 103 possibilities typical game lasts 40 moves resignation one party conservative calculation since machine would calculate unk resignation however even figure unk variations calculated initial position machine operating rate one variation per unk would require unk years calculate first move

parliament act 1911
parliament act 1911 act parliament united kingdom unk important partly governs relationship house commons house lords make houses parliament act must construed one parliament act 1949 two acts may cited together parliament acts 1911 1949
following rejection 1909 people unk house commons sought establish formal dominance house lords broken convention opposing bill budget eventually passed lords commons democratic mandate confirmed holding elections january 1910 following parliament act looked prevent recurrence budget problems also widely opposed lords cross party discussion failed particularly proposed act unk passing irish home rule bill second general election december act passed support monarch george v threatened create sufficient liberal peers overcome conservative majority
act effectively removed right lords veto money bills completely replaced right veto public bills maximum delay two years also reduced maximum term parliament seven years five
background
parliament act 1911 way resolve contradictions two houses parliament except creation additional peers monarch queen anne created 12 tory peers vote treaty unk unk reform act 1832 passed house lords dropped opposition william iv threatened create 80 new peers request prime minister earl grey creating informal convention lords would give way public behind house commons example irish unk major bone contention two main parties since 1830s following intervention queen passed lords 1869 unk gladstone 1868 election issue however practice gave lords right demand public support present decide timing general election
prevailing wisdom house lords could amend money bills since house commons right decide upon resources monarch could call upon however despite apparent contradiction prevent rejecting bills outright 1860 repeal paper duties money bills consolidated single budget denied lords ability reject individual components prospect voting entire budget seemingly unk 1909 became possibility act lords equal rights legislation compared commons unk right veto financial measures convention
overwhelming conservative unionist majority lords since liberal split 1886 liberal party attempting push significant welfare reforms considerable popular support seemed certain cause problems relationship houses 1906 1909 several important measures considerably watered rejected outright example unk introduced education bill 1906 intended address unk grievances arising education act 1902 amended lords extent effectively different bill upon commons dropped bill led 26 june 1907 resolution house commons declaring lords power curtailed put forward liberal prime minister henry campbell unk 1909 hoping force election lords rejected financial bill based government budget people unk put forward david lloyd george 350 votes 75 according commons breach constitution unk rights commons lords suggested commons justify position representing people january 1910 general election liberal government lost heavily remained majority help significant number irish nationalist labour mps irish nationalists saw continued power lords detrimental securing irish home rule following election lords relented budget since reintroduced government passing lords 28 april day commons
passage
lords faced prospect parliament act considerable support irish nationalists series meetings liberal government conservative opposition members agreed twenty one meetings held 16 june 10 november discussions considered wide range proposals initial agreement finance bills joint sitting house commons lords means enforce commons superiority controversial areas number lords present would limited liberal majority 50 house commons could unk lords however issue home rule ireland main contention unk looking exempt law parliament act procedure means general exception constitutional structural bills liberals supported exception bills relating monarchy protestant succession home rule unk declared failed 10 november
government threatened another dissolution parliament act passed followed threat opposition lords unk elections december produced little change january calling second dissolution parliament seems contrary wishes edward vii edward died may 1910 crisis still progress successor george v asked would prepared create sufficient peers would matter arose would meant creating 400 new liberal peers king however demand would rejected least lords intervention two amendments made lords rejected opposition showed little sign slipping led asquith declare king intention overcome majority house lords creating sufficient new peers passed lords 131 votes 114 votes majority 17 reflected large number unk
provisions
unk included words intended substitute house lords present exists second chamber constituted popular instead hereditary basis substitution cannot immediately brought operation request prominent cabinet member sir edward grey long title act act make provision respect powers house lords relation house commons limit duration parliament section 8 defined short title parliament act 1911
bill also attempt place relationship house commons house lords new footing well direct issue money bills set new conventions power lords continued hold would used change composition lords however
lords would able delay money bills one month effectively ending ability defined public bill contained provisions dealing imposition repeal remission alteration regulation taxation imposition payment debt financial purposes charges consolidated fund money provided parliament variation repeal charges supply appropriation unk custody issue audit accounts public money raising guarantee loan repayment unk however cover sort local taxes similar measures finance bills fallen within criterion consolidated fund unk bills speaker house commons would unk bill money bill unk speaker certificate local government finance bill 1988 introduced community charge poll tax certified money bill therefore considered lords whilst finance bills considered money bills convention dictates parts finance bill dealing taxation expenditure act alone would constitute money bill questioned
public bills could longer vetoed instead could delayed two years two year period meant legislation introduced fourth fifth years parliament could delayed next election could prove effective measure prevent passed specifically two years unk second reading house commons first session passing bill house commons third session speaker also unk conditions bill complied significant restrictions amendments made ensure bill rejected twice 1911 act made clear life parliament could extended without consent lords
parliament limited maximum seven years unk act unk reduced passing parliament act 1911 parliament would limited five years beginning first meeting parliament election practice election forced limitation parliaments dissolved monarch request prime minister noted however five year maximum duration referred lifetime parliament interval general unk example 2010 general election held five years one day 2005 general election whilst 1992 general election held 9 april 1992 next general election held 1 may 1997 reduction parliament length seen counterbalance new powers granted commons
unk
lords continued suggest amendments money bills right veto several instances accepted commons included china unk bill 1925 inshore unk industry bill 1947 use lords temporary veto remains powerful check legislation
used relation government ireland act 1914 threat lords veto removed ulster protestants firmly passing bill however never came force outbreak first world war amendments parliament act 1911 made prolong life 1910 parliament following outbreak first world war 1935 parliament second world war made special exemptions requirement hold election every five years
legislation passed parliament act without consent lords still considered primary legislation importance highlighted jackson v attorney general legality parliament act 1949 questioned challenge asserted foremost 1949 act delegated rather primary legislation 1911 act delegated power commons case commons could unk 1949 act without direct permission lords since passed 1911 act never received required consent lords however 1949 act found legal 1911 act concluded primarily unk commons rather restrict ability lords affect legislation ruling also means efforts abolish house lords major constitutional change using act could successful although issue directly addressed ruling
analysis
parliament act 1911 seen context british constitution rather creating written constitution parliament chose instead unk usual channels response crisis unk response avoided problems unk unwritten rules unk entire government commonly considered statute constitutional importance gives informal priority parliament courts regards whether later legislation change process may happen
also mentioned discussion constitutional convention whilst replaced conventions regarding role house lords also relies several others section 1 1 makes sense money bills arise house lords provisions section 2 1 proceedings public bill completed single session otherwise must fail put procedure
